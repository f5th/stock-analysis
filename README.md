# stock-analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

Refactor previous used code in order to handle larger datasets, in this case, create arrays to loop over all tickers.

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### Performance

The fact that new items were introduced, such as arrays within the code, the execution time was not visibly affected, as a matter of fact, the speed was sligtly faster, but would be hard to notice without a timer. Both **[2017](https://github.com/f5th/stock-analysis/blob/b508f2b17b2f68ac499e195026496dce825b68ba/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)** and [2018](https://github.com/f5th/stock-analysis/blob/b508f2b17b2f68ac499e195026496dce825b68ba/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png) have similar execution time.


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**

Advantages are performance and long term solutions to problems that are contstantly repeating.  The disadvantages will come for the most part to begginers, since we are not used to complex code, some items that we just started to discover might be normal to more experienced VBA developers.  So plain code migth still be or *go to* when it comes to make macros.


**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

There was some debuggin even within the steps given, but as far as the code itself, it was quite similar. the idea of having the array make sense if there was a way to automatically detect the different stocks without having to declare from the beggining.
